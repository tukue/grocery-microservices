# Feature Definition Before Vercel Deployment

Use this template before implementing or deploying a customer-facing feature.
It turns a product need into testable requirements and makes frontend, API,
security, and deployment dependencies explicit. Copy the template below into a
feature-specific document and replace every prompt; mark items out of scope
with a reason rather than leaving them ambiguous.

For a full requirements specification, use
[`../.specify/templates/spec-template.md`](../.specify/templates/spec-template.md).
For implementation guidance, see
[`frontend-implementation-approach.md`](frontend-implementation-approach.md)
and the [Vercel deployment guide](frontend-vercel-deployment.md). For backend
features and service rollout, use the
[backend feature-definition template](backend-feature-definition-before-deployment.md).

## Feature brief template

### Summary

- **Feature name:**
- **Owner:**
- **Status:** Draft / Approved / In progress / Ready to deploy
- **Target release:**
- **Related issue or spec:**

### Problem and value

- **Who has the problem?**
- **What are they trying to do?**
- **What problem or friction do they face today?**
- **Why should we solve it now?**
- **Expected customer or business value:**

### Scope

- **In scope:**
- **Out of scope:**
- **Assumptions and constraints:**

### User journey and acceptance criteria

Describe the primary journey from the user's starting point to a successful
outcome. Include important alternate and failure paths.

| Priority | User story | Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]. | Given [context], when [action], then [observable result]. |

Also define the relevant loading, empty, validation, unauthorized, unavailable,
and retry states. State which behavior is required on mobile and desktop.

### Product success

Define a measurable outcome, how it will be measured, and a target. Prefer user
outcomes over implementation metrics.

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How / when it is measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [e.g. task completion rate] | [current value or unknown] | [target] | [event, dashboard, or test] |

### Engineering and integration

- **Frontend routes/components affected:**
- **Services or APIs involved:**
- **API contract:** document request/response shapes, errors, ownership,
  validation, and retry/idempotency behavior; link to the contract.
- **Data changes and source of truth:**
- **Authentication and authorization:**
- **Configuration and environment variables:**
- **Dependencies, migrations, or external services:**

Keep privileged credentials and service-only secrets on the server. Values
bundled into the Vite client (including `VITE_*` variables) are public.
The browser should call relative `/api/...` routes rather than microservices
directly.

### Quality, privacy, and operations

- **Security and privacy:** data collected, access rules, retention, and
  sensitive-data handling.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard use, labels, focus behavior, and relevant assistive
  technology expectations.
- **Analytics and logging:** events or operational signals needed; do not log
  secrets or unnecessary personal data.
- **Failure and recovery:** user-visible errors, retry behavior, and fallback or
  support path.
- **Rollout and rollback:** release scope, feature-flag/configuration needs, and
  how to disable or revert safely.

### Verification plan

- **Unit/component tests:**
- **API/integration tests:**
- **End-to-end scenarios:**
- **Manual checks:** supported browsers, screen sizes, and important user paths.
- **Production-build checks:** formatting, lint, type check, tests, and build.

### Vercel release gate

Before deploying, confirm each applicable item:

- [ ] Product owner has approved scope and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Required API/BFF services and production data dependencies are available.
- [ ] Vercel project root, install/build commands, output directory, and Node
  version match [`frontend-vercel-deployment.md`](frontend-vercel-deployment.md).
- [ ] Required production environment variables are configured in Vercel and
  are not exposed to the browser bundle.
- [ ] Production API routing, CORS/cookie policy, authentication, and HTTPS
  behavior are configured for the deployed origins.
- [ ] Formatting, lint, type checks, relevant automated tests, and production
  build pass.
- [ ] Deployed smoke checks cover the feature's success path and at least one
  relevant failure/recovery path.
- [ ] Monitoring, owner, and rollback/disable procedure are known.

**Release decision:** GO / NO-GO  
**Decision owner and date:**  
**Known risks or follow-up work:**
